Cost estimation:

For the costs we are calculating a payment of 20€ per hour per person, because we think this is a
realistic value based on previous experiences and considering that a hour of a programmer at an
IT-companycosts about 80-100€, so all 4 of us togehter should be worth at least as much.

The baselayout for our calculations was this  [Application Development Project Work Breakdown Structure](http://www.theprojectdiva.com/application-development-project-work-breakdown-structure/)

* 1.1. Application Development Project Management (4h)
    * 1.1.2. Resource Management Plan 2h
    * 1.1.3. Scope Development 0.5h
    * 1.1.6. Budget 0.5h
    * 1.1.7. Scheduling 0.5h
    * 1.1.8. Document Change Control Processes 0.5h
* 1.2. Application Architecture (22h)
    * 1.2.1. Functional Specifications
        * 1.2.1.1. Process Models 10h
        * 1.2.1.2. User Interface 8h
        * 1.2.1.3. Database Model 4h
* 1.3. Application Development (88h)
    * 1.3.1. Setup Development Environment 8h
    * 1.3.2. UI Development 30h
    * 1.3.3. Code Development 50h
* 1.4. Application Testing (20h)
    * 1.4.1. Test Environment Setup 4h
    * 1.4.2. Unit Testing 10h
    * 1.4.3. Results Reporting 6h
* 1.5. Application Deployment  (8h)
    * 1.5.1. Documentation
        * 1.5.1.1. End User Documentation 8h

Alltogether: 142h
Costs 142h * 20€/h = 2840€
Considering that there might be unexpected problems our proposal would be 3000€ for the whole project.
